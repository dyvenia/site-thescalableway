  **Purpose** (What is the purpose of this article?):

  The purpose of this article is to explain what a data platform is. We want to give confidence to the reader in our reference architecture by explaining a bit of the history of data platforms and then giving some thoughts around modularity. Some readers might come from a more classic IT background, and they might have different terminologies, such as OLAP cubes, data warehouse, and cubes. We want the reader to not only understand the typical modern data platform reference architecture, which is everywhere now but also to understand the importance of modularity and good design decisions. 

  **Outline:**

  - Introduction
  - History of data platforms: from OLAP cubes, to Hadoop, to Lakehouses
  - Reference architecture of a modern and modular data platform

Modern data analytics can get complicated. With an abundance of tools, conflicting methodologies, and ever-evolving technologies, mistakes can be costly. However, at its core, data analytics remains grounded in a few fundamental principles. Understanding these fundamentals while leveraging modular and well-designed data platforms can significantly improve operational efficiency and decision-making.

## **History of Data Platforms: From OLAP Cubes to Hadoop to Lakehouses**

The evolution of data platforms has been driven by two primary goals:

- **Doing Analytics Better:** improving analytics work with more efficient storage and retrieval of business and machine data; moving insights generation closer to the domain experts by improving self-service tools and processes
- **Doing Better Analytics:** increasing the value of analytics by having more and deeper insights; leverage statistical modeling, machine learning, and AI to improve the quality of business decisions

And so, while SQL, which was invented in 1975, remains at the core of analytics, there have been significant advances in technology. 

OLAP cubes emerged in 1993, introducing multi-dimensional analysis. In the early 2000s, Hadoop revolutionized big data processing, allowing distributed storage and computing. More recently, the Lakehouse paradigm has sought to unify the best aspects of data warehouses and data lakes, improving performance, governance, and flexibility.

## **Reference Architecture of a Modern and Modular Data Platform**

A modern data platform consists of several key components, each playing a crucial role in the data lifecycle. These components enable efficient data movement, transformation, and consumption while ensuring modularity and scalability.

#### **Data Sources**

Data sources are the origin of information within an organization. These range from structured databases, APIs, and SaaS applications to unstructured sources such as logs, IoT streams, and social media feeds. Some sources offer modern APIs for easy integration, while others, particularly legacy systems, require extensive workarounds.

#### **Ingestion**

Ingestion refers to the process of transferring data from sources into the platform reliably. This is typically done via scheduled batch jobs, though some architectures incorporate real-time ingestion using event brokers like Kafka.

The ingestion landscape is fragmented, with numerous tools available, such as Azure Data Factory and Fivetran. However, no tool provides connectors for every possible source. Consequently, organizations often need to develop custom connectors, leading to maintenance challenges and dependencies on vendors.

#### **Landing**

Landing zones serve as the initial storage layer where raw, unprocessed data is deposited after ingestion. This stage ensures that data is captured in its original form, preserving fidelity and enabling downstream transformation.

Storage for this type of data (including lakehouse data) has been standardized around the AWS S3 object storage API. Consequently, most cloud providers now offer their own variations of object storage with APIs closely mirroring AWS S3.

#### **Preparation**

Since raw data can be messy and inconsistent, preparation is necessary to clean, standardize, and format it for further processing. This stage includes:

- Data masking
- Data anonymization
- Structuring into standardized formats such as Delta Tables or Apache Iceberg Parquet files

Note that both data masking and anonymization could be done also during landing on data “in-transit” to avoid storing sensitive information on the platform. 

Data engineers typically handle this step using workflow tools like Alteryx, Azure Data Factory, or programming languages such as Python.

#### **Modeling**

Modeling transforms prepared data into well-structured datasets optimized for analytical use. Historically, this was the "T" in ETL (Extract, Transform, Load). Today, tools like dbt have popularized the concept of modular and scalable transformation workflows.

#### **Consumption**

Once modeled, data is consumed in various ways, including:

- Traditional dashboards and Excel reports
- Embedded analytics within applications
- AI-powered data exploration (e.g., generative AI and natural language querying)

#### **Data Cataloging**

A data catalog is a comprehensive inventory of an organization's data assets, documenting their structure, relationships, and usage. It extends beyond datasets to include analytical assets such as dashboards, reports, and Jupyter notebooks, ensuring a unified and well-organized view of available information.

Despite its critical role in data management, data cataloging is often overlooked or deprioritized in analytics projects. However, a well-maintained data catalog is fundamental to effective data governance and security. By systematically identifying all data assets, their ownership, and their respective domains, organizations can enhance discoverability, streamline compliance efforts, and facilitate data democratization.

#### **Data Orchestration**

Data orchestration refers to the automated coordination of ETL processes, from data ingestion and preparation to final modeling for consumption. It ensures that data flows seamlessly across different stages, reducing manual intervention and improving efficiency.

This industry is highly fragmented, with traditional IT approaches relying on UI-based tools such as Talend and Azure Data Factory. More modern methodologies, however, focus on code-driven orchestration using tools like Apache Airflow and Prefect. These newer solutions provide greater flexibility, scalability, and integration capabilities, making them preferred choices for organizations aiming to build robust and automated data pipelines.

## **Understanding Modularity in the Context of Data Platforms**

Unlike ERP systems, which are often monolithic, data platforms are inherently modular. The diversity of data workflows and use cases makes it impractical to consolidate everything into a single tool.

Some vendors, such as Databricks and Microsoft Fabric, attempt to provide an all-in-one solution. However, even these platforms require integration with external components to cover all aspects of data management.

### **Components and Interfaces Before Tools**

The success of a data platform hinges on well-defined interfaces between its components. A common pitfall is over-reliance on a single vendor, leading to inflexible architectures that struggle to adapt to evolving business needs. Organizations should prioritize:

- Well-defined interfaces between tools
- Single point for managing accesses (i.e., using A/D groups)
- Loose coupling between components to enable flexibility

### **Workflows and Developer Experience**

A streamlined developer experience is crucial for maintaining data platform efficiency. Poorly designed workflows can introduce bottlenecks, reduce productivity, and increase technical debt. Best practices include:

- Automating repetitive tasks (e.g., CI/CD for data pipelines)
- Enforcing coding standards and documentation
- Providing self-service capabilities for data consumers

### **Data Governance and Security**

With numerous tools and evolving datasets, data governance and security must be proactive rather than reactive. **Traditional IT governance models, which assume static datasets, are insufficient for modern data platforms**. Without a structured approach to creating and managing new data assets, governance becomes **impossible**.

Effective data governance requires:

- Clear company policies on data access, privacy, and security.
- A solid understanding of analytics workflows to incorporate governance steps and audit reviews seamlessly.
- Automated data cataloging to maintain visibility into data assets and their ownership.
- A comprehensive inventory of all analytics tools, ensuring each one is correctly configured and continuously monitored for compliance.

While data governance is straightforward in principle, it requires a structured, realistic approach with well-defined steps to ensure its successful implementation and long-term effectiveness.

## **Conclusion**

Modern data platforms are modular ecosystems that require careful design and governance to be effective. By understanding the historical evolution of data architectures, organizations can make informed decisions about structuring their platforms. Prioritizing interoperability, developer experience, and security ensures a scalable and efficient data operations strategy.

Organizations that embrace modularity and best practices in data management will not only improve operational efficiency but also gain a competitive advantage in an increasingly data-driven world.
