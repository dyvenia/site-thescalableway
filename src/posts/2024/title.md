  **Audience:** Data Engineer / DevOps Engineer trying to setup data platform

  **Purpose:** (Internal usage only):

  How-to document that explains all necessary steps to prepare basic infrastructure for running data platform with Terraform on Google Cloud Platform.

  **Outline:**Â 

  1. **Introduction**

  - What are we trying to achieve? // Data platform on GCP, without setting up any source system or target data warehouse.
  - Why a server-based approach with a single VM?
  - Reference to the previous article that covers the architectural decision-making process.

  ### **2. Infrastructure Overview**

  - **Explanation of key components:**
      - VPC & Subnet
      - Compute Engine
      - Firewall rules
      - IAP SSH Permissions
      - Cloud Router & Cloud NAT
      - Cloud Storage
  - **Understanding GCP IAP** (Deep dive into how Identity-Aware Proxy works and why it's important for security of data platform)

  ### **3. Technical Prerequisites**

  - Installing necessary tools:
      - Terraform
      - gcloud CLI
      - kubectl or Lens (for Kubernetes cluster management)
  - Setting up GCP access:
      - Creating a GCP Service Account
      - Enabling required APIs

  ### **4. Installing & Deploying infrastructure with Terraform**

  - Initializing and applying Terraform configurations to provision resources
  - Details about setting up K3S during Terraform initialization

  ### **5. Connecting to the Kubernetes Cluster**

  - Authenticating with GKE
  - Verifying the setup using kubectl or Lens

## Installing Terraform

Terraform can be installed in various ways, which are outlined [by Hashicorp here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install). For Ubuntu, installation can be done with the following commands:

```bash

wget -O - https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list

sudo apt update && sudo apt install terraform

```

## gcloud CLI installation

Similarly to Terraform, the gcloud CLI can be installed as per the [official instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install). For Ubuntu, run:

```bash

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates gnupg curl

curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg] https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt cloud-sdk main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-cloud-sdk.list

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install google-cloud-cli

```
