# The Scalable Way


### Blog Contribution Guidelines

Blog articles are markdown files inside the `src/posts` folder. The top of the markdown has a YAML section to define article metadata such as title, description and publish date.

**Code Blocks** are possible with the typical "```" opening and closing. Documentation on syntax highlighting and code blocks is [here](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/syntaxhighlight/).

**images** should be stored in `src/images`.

### To Dos
- optimize the syntax css load in css-inline.njk (now using a CDN)
- Add a section on this readme on how to use chatgpt in visual studio to correct and clean up the english
